# Task 2: Styling with the CSS Box Model

This project is an evolution of Task 1, where I have transformed a semantic HTML structure into a visually organized personal profile. The primary focus of this task was implementing the **CSS Box Model** and understanding **Cascading** behavior.

## 🎯 Task Objectives
- Implement a separate `style.css` file linked to the HTML document.
- Use **Margin, Border, and Padding** to create professional spacing.
- Establish a clear visual hierarchy through typography and color.
- Refactor styles into **reusable CSS classes** for scalability.

## 📦 The CSS Box Model Implementation
In this project, I treated every element as a box to control the layout:
* **Content:** Styled with specific font families and colors for readability.
* **Padding:** Added internal space to prevent text from touching borders.
* **Border:** Used to visually define sections and headers.
* **Margin:** Utilized to create consistent gaps between different content sections.

## 🛠️ Tools & Workflow
- **VS Code:** For writing clean, class-based CSS.
- **Browser DevTools:** Used extensively to inspect elements and fine-tune spacing in real-time.
- **Global Styling:** Applied base styles to the `body` tag to demonstrate CSS cascading.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html`: Semantic structure (from Task 1) updated with styling classes.
- `style.css`: All layout and design rules, avoiding inline styles for better maintenance.

## 🚀 How to View
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Use the "Inspect" tool (F12) to see the Box Model properties applied to the `.box-container` and other elements.
